👋 Hi, I’m Antonio

Frontend developer focused on solid foundations, clear architecture, and systems that are built to last.

I don’t chase trends or frameworks.
I prioritize intention, domain modeling, and data flow before writing a single line of implementation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🧠 HOW I THINK

- Intention first, then architecture finally, code
- JavaScript as a foundation, not an accessory
- State is a concept, not a global variable
- Refactoring is not rewriting — it’s understanding better

I build frontend systems that:
- Can be explained
- Can be defended
- Can be maintained

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🧭 WHAT I’M WORKING ON NOW

I’m currently developing frontend projects where I practice:
- Clear separation of layers (UI, interaction, domain, orchestration)
- Designing for future change, not rigid solutions
- Removing unnecessary coupling
- Treating code reading and writing as core skills

Each project is a laboratory for decision-making, not just a visual result.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🛠️ STACK (what I actually use)

🧱 Fundamentals
- Semantic HTML
- Modern CSS
- JavaScript (ES6+)

🎨 STYLING
- Sass (structure, variables, consistency)

🔧 TOOLS
- Git / GitHub
- Version control with intention, not random commits

(I prefer mastering fewer tools deeply rather than listing many superficially)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🧩 WORK PHILOSOPHY 

- Code communicates ideas, not just instructions
- Clarity is a form of respect for the future
- Technical decisions should be explainable
- Architecture is not overengineering when it has purpose

I choose to move slowly now to move faster later.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🎯 GOAL

To become a competitive frontend developer with strong technical judgment, capable of:

- Designing frontend systems from scratch
- Reading unfamiliar code with confidence
- Making decisions and standing behind them with arguments

I’m not looking for shortcuts.
I’m building solid foundations.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

📌 FINAL NOTE

If something in my repositories feels “over-thought”, it probably is.
That’s intentional.

Intention and architecture first. Implementation comes later. 

                          =====> MANY DEVELOPERS SHOW CODE. FEW SHOW HOW THEY THINK. THAT’S MY EDGE. <=====
